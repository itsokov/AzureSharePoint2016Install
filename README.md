# AzureSharePoint2016Install

This script builds upon John Savill's blogpost https://savilltech.com/2016/08/10/automating-deployments-to-azure-iaas-with-custom-actions/

It will deploy a SharePoint 2016 Dev machine on Azure with minimum interaction.

To run simply download Run.ps1 and execute in an elevated PowerShell.

All assets will be downloaded for you. Only input expected is the password for the accounts that will be created and your Azure login.

This script does not store your Azure credential.
